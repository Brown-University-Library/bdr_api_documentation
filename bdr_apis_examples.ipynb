    "# BDR API info and examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brown Digital Repository is most known for its [website]. But it also has an [API]. \n",
    "\n",
    "An API (\"Application Programming Interface\") can be thought of as a protocol, or a structured way of communicating information. If you go to the BDR to perform a search, the webapp queries the BDR-API on that search-term. The API then returns structured data to the webapp, which uses it to display the web-page of results you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BDR API allows people to create their own web-pages or scripts that can access BDR data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this page is to share examples of the kinds of BDR API queries people can make. This format of using a Jupyter notebook allows you to tweak the queries and interact with real BDR public data.\n",
